    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil or melted butter</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups warm water (around 110째F or 45째C)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup rolled oats for topping</li>
      <li>
        1/4 cup mixed seeds (such as sunflower seeds, flaxseeds, or sesame
        seeds) for extra texture and flavor
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Proof the Yeast: In a small bowl, combine warm water and honey (or maple
        syrup). Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5-10
        minutes, or until it becomes frothy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the
        whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: Make a well in the center of the dry
        ingredients and pour in the activated yeast mixture and olive oil (or
        melted butter). Use a wooden spoon or a mixer with a dough hook to
        combine the wet and dry ingredients until a dough starts to form.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead the Dough: Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it
        for about 10 minutes, or until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. If
        using a mixer with a dough hook, knead on low speed for about 8-10
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        First Rise: Place the kneaded dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it
        with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm,
        draft-free area for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the Loaf: After the first rise, punch down the dough to release
        the air. Shape it into a loaf by stretching the dough into an oval shape
        and then rolling it up tightly. Pinch the seams to seal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Second Rise: Place the shaped dough into a greased loaf pan and cover it
        with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Let it rise for another 30-45
        minutes, or until it rises just above the edges of the loaf pan.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the Oven: Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C).</li>
      <li>
        Optional Toppings: If desired, brush the top of the risen loaf with
        water and sprinkle rolled oats and mixed seeds on top for added texture
        and flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the Bread: Place the loaf in the preheated oven and bake for about
        30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the bread sounds
        hollow when tapped on the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool and Enjoy: Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the
        pan for a few minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool
        completely before slicing. Enjoy your delicious homemade whole wheat
        bread with your favorite spreads or use it for sandwiches.
