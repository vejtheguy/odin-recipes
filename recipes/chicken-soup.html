            <li>
              In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
              Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and saut√© until the onion
              becomes translucent and the garlic becomes fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the diced carrots and celery to the pot, and cook for a few
              minutes until they begin to soften.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour in the chicken broth and add the garlic bouillon and chicken
              bouillon. Stir well to dissolve the bouillon in the broth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Grate the fresh ginger into the pot and add the umami seasoning if
              using. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bring the soup to a simmer and let it cook for about 15 minutes,
              allowing the flavors to meld together.

            <li>
              Add the peas to the soup and continue to simmer for an additional
              5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a separate pot, cook the egg noodles according to the package
              instructions until they are al dente. Drain the noodles and set
              them aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the shredded rotisserie chicken to the soup, stirring to
              combine. Let the soup simmer for a few more minutes until the
              chicken is heated through.
            </li>
            <li>
              Just before serving, stir in the lemon juice to brighten the
              flavors of the soup.
            </li>
            <li>
              To serve, divide the cooked egg noodles among the bowls, and ladle
