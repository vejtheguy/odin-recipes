          <h3>Steps:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Prepare the Meat Sauce: In a large skillet or saucepan, cook the
              ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned.
              Drain any excess fat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic,
              cooking until the onion is translucent and fragrant. Stir in the
              crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, dried basil, dried
              oregano, dried thyme, and red pepper flakes (if using). Season
              with salt and pepper to taste. Let the sauce simmer on low heat
              for about 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make the Cheese Filling: In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese,
              shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, egg, chopped parsley, salt,
              and pepper. Mix until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>
              Assemble the Lasagna: In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin
              layer of the meat sauce to coat the bottom. Arrange 4 lasagna
              noodles over the sauce. Spread half of the cheese filling evenly
              over the noodles. Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded mozzarella over the
              cheese filling, and then sprinkle 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan on
              top. Add another layer of meat sauce, followed by another layer of
              noodles, the remaining cheese filling, another cup of shredded
              mozzarella, and the remaining grated Parmesan. Finish with a final
              layer of meat sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake the Lasagna: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and
              bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and
              bake for an additional 15-20 minutes or until the top is bubbly
              and lightly browned.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let it Rest: Allow the lasagna to rest for 10-15 minutes before
              serving. This helps it set and makes it easier to slice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Serve and Enjoy: Slice the delicious lasagna into portions and
              serve it hot. Garnish with extra chopped parsley or basil if
              desired.
